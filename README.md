This project aims to enhance traffic prediction by leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques combined with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models. The goal is to predict future traffic conditions by utilizing spatio-temporal data while reducing reliance on labeled data, which is often costly and difficult to obtain.
